I created a directory migr-utils where the seed.yaml and migrate.yaml are. 

The containers db-migr and db-seed are copies of the original db container. I am sure this can be optimized, but this may be an overkill for an operation that is not frequent. 

The admin username and password were also exposed, so I created another secret: secret-admin.yaml.
Before running these utils we have to apply the secret:
kubectl apply ./migr-utils/secret-admin.yaml

The commands are:
kubectl apply -f migrate.yaml
and 
kubectl apply -f seed.yaml

Most if it is copied from manual experimentation inside the pods using $ kubectl exec -it â€¦
